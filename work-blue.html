            <p>A Property Management System (PMS) can be thought of as the central nervous system of a hotel. The enterprise software handles everything from reservations and billing to coordinating room allocation and cleaning. There is no shortage of PMS solutions on the market but users we interviewed told us that these legacy applications take weeks to learn and are universally loathed for their clunky, confusing UIs and convoluted flows.</p>
            <p>At Novility we set out to create a new SaaS PMS from the ground up using the latest technology stack and placing the user at the centre of the design approach. </p>
            <h2>Role</h2>
            <p>I joined a scrum team of developers and business analysts and after a couple of months was asked by the product owner to take on the role of lead designer. I was responsible for the overall design direction, coaching the other UX designers and user-researchers as well as contributing to the detailed design work and managing the component-based design system to ensure that our designs were consistent.</p>
            <h2>Iterative design</h2>
            <p>We took an iterative approach to creating the product, initially tackling the core functionality one module at a time so that we had a good basis on which to test and innovate. Each module began with an initial research & analysis phase consisting of interviewing users of existing solutions about their pain points and documenting business processes. This fed into an ideation session where all members of the team collaborated to sketch out some initial directions, followed by cycles of detailed design, prototyping and user testing.</p>
            <p>Basing the design around user goals and iterating on user feedback allowed us to optimise the UI so that user could complete processes efficiently and without the repetitive hacks and workarounds they were used to carrying out on legacy systems.</p>

            <h2>Optimizing the reservation flow</h2>
            <p>One example of this is approach can be seen in the design of the reservations module. On legacy systems, taking a reservation is a convoluted process that requires users to jump between multiple popup windows to retrieve a guest's details, check availability and prices and take a deposit payment. Our first attempt to streamline this was to collapse all of these steps into a single page. Feedback from user testing was generally positive but uncovered a few problems with the approach - a user could miss a crucial step or get lost after switching back from another task (hotel employees are always multi-tasking).</p>
