        Samsam is an editorially independent educational magazine. A crossmedia
        platform where children can get to know everything about the world and
        their role within it. &ldquo;Playing, looking, investigating and
        learning&rdquo; are central. At IJsfontein I led the design of a new,
        modern digital platform that stimulates curiosity and encourages
        exploration of the content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each team member installs the app which is linked to the team-specific
        programme with assignments and content chosen by the coach. The users
        complete a daily reflection which over time provides an insight into
        what gives them energy, and what takes it away. The app also facilitates
        assignments in four categories: perspective, autonomy, connection and
        growth.

      <h2>Responsive &amp; future-proof</h2>
      <p>
        The platform is designed to be future-proof and flexible. Using
        responsive-design techniques, I worked on a flexible grid with layout
        adjustments that optimises the site for tablet, desktop and digiboard
        (digital whiteboard). I defined the interaction design in a series of
        responsive components which give the content editors a modular, scalable
        system in which to create content that is less restricting than a
        typical template-based CMS.
      </p>
      <p>
        The content can be filtered in different ways. Select a subject or
        filter by clicking on the world map. Teachers have there own section
        with lesson ideas and an archive of teaching material. After testing the
        site with schoolchildren, I did some further design to make the
        connection between the map, filters and content thumbnails more obvious.
        It was also interesting to see from analytics data how the search field
        is a popular starting point. We improved the search functionality with
        instant (as you type) results, and suggestions for misspelled words to
        help children find countries with difficult spelling.

        After launch of the new publishing platform, Samsam approached us to
        think about ideas for how we can engage kids and schools. I helped
        facilitate several workshops and creative sessions which lead to the
        Reportersclub concept.
      </p>

      <p>
        The idea is to provide school classes with a tool that goes beyond just
        another social network or user-generated-content platform. The site
        provides specific features that help kids work together in teams, and
        challenges them with subjects to investigate in the form of "Missions".
      </p>

      <p>
        As an interaction designer is was exciting to work on complex
        collaborative tools and make them accessible, yet sufficiently rich in
        possibilities for self-expression, for the younger users. I prototyped
        the site and mobile app using Axure while working together with
        developers with an agile approach. I also helped out with some of the
        visual design tasks during the later stages of production.
