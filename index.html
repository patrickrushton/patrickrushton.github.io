        <h2>Tools</h2>
        <p class="section-description">
          I have mastered several tools that play a role in defining and
          communicating the user-experience. Based on the project and team,
          I am able to adapt my process and choose the best tools for the job.

              <p>
                I have extensive experience using Figma for visual interface
                design and setting up and maintaining design systems.

              <p>
                As an early adopter of Sketch I have used it extensively on a
                range of projects from mobile apps to complete design systems.

              <h3>Axure RP</h3>
              <p>
                I am familiar with many prototyping tools, and Axure has a nice
                balance of power and speed which are essential for getting early
                feedback on designs.

              <p>
                An understanding of modern front-end helps me create feasible
                designs and collaborate with developers. I will often code
                specific behaviours such as responsive scaling.
