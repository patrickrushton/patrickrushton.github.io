                Patrick always provided an excellent common sense view of the
                problems we were trying to solve or the features we were trying
                to make. Patrick makes excellent storyboards, which greatly help
                in the technical design process. While he can visualise a great
                product, he can also tackle technically complex ideas and tools.
                It was a pleasure to work with him.
