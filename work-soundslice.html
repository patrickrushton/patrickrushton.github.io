        Soundslice is a web-based music-learning platform that helps musicians learn pieces of music by synchronizing notation with video and audio, and providing tools for looping, slowing down and transcribing music. The software is used to deliver Soundslice's own courses, by teachers as a way to supplement their lessons, and by third-parties who license the technology and embed it in their own applications.
      </p>
      <p>
      The developers of Soundslice approached me to help them with some user-interface challenges that they have been struggling with, and to design a new landing page to help market the embeddable product to potential licensing partners.

      <h2>User-interface enhancements</h2>
      <div class="fit"><img src="images/work-soundslice-crop.png" alt="Screenshot of the Soundslice cropping UI"></div>
      <p>
        When teachers are transcribing a piece of music, they often need to isolate a section from a longer piece of music but there was no straightforward way of doing so in the user-interface. I designed an intuitive solution that allows the user to drag start- and end-braces in the waveform display.
      </p>
      <p>
        The content can be filtered in different ways. Select a subject or
        filter by clicking on the world map. Teachers have there own section
        with lesson ideas and an archive of teaching material. After testing the
        site with schoolchildren, I did some further design to make the
        connection between the map, filters and content thumbnails more obvious.
        It was also interesting to see from analytics data how the search field
        is a popular starting point. We improved the search functionality with
        instant (as you type) results, and suggestions for misspelled words to
        help children find countries with difficult spelling.

        After launch of the new publishing platform, Samsam approached us to
        think about ideas for how we can engage kids and schools. I helped
        facilitate several workshops and creative sessions which lead to the
        Reportersclub concept.
      </p>

      <p>
        The idea is to provide school classes with a tool that goes beyond just
        another social network or user-generated-content platform. The site
        provides specific features that help kids work together in teams, and
        challenges them with subjects to investigate in the form of "Missions".
      </p>

      <p>
        As an interaction designer is was exciting to work on complex
        collaborative tools and make them accessible, yet sufficiently rich in
        possibilities for self-expression, for the younger users. I prototyped
        the site and mobile app using Axure while working together with
        developers with an agile approach. I also helped out with some of the
        visual design tasks during the later stages of production.
